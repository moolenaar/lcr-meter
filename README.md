# lcr-meter


Design Goals
------------
 * Hand held, battery operated device,
 * Measures resistors, capacitors and inductors,
 * Screen update rate of 3 Hz,
 * Proven accuracy of 3%,
 * Each displayed measurement value is within the accuracy range (no need to wait for the reading to stabilize),
 * components are measured using a sinusoidal signal, 
 * Electronics design and PCB design,
 * Use cheap, commonly available components,
 * Software for the device and for the PC,
 * case that can be made with a 3D printer.

Features
--------
 * Auto component detection; the meter automatically determines the type of component connected,
 * Auto ranging; the meter selects automatically the most appropriate measurement range,
 * Capacitors can be measured in the range 10 pF up to 1000 uF,
 * Inductors can be measured in the range 100nH up to 1H,
 * Resistors can be measured in the range 10 Ohm up to 2 MOhm,
 * The meter can be monitored and operated from a PC,
 * Graphic LCD screen with the value displayed in large digits.
